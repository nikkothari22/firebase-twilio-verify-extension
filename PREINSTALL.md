Use this extension to send one time verification codes to your users and verify them. The extension uses [Twilio's Verify service](https://www.twilio.com/verify) to send and check codes.

There are two functions in the extension - one to send the code and the other validate the code. Both of these are meant to be called from your app (they are onCall() functions).

The function `twilioSendOTP` needs to be called with two variables: `channel` ("sms" or "call") and `number` - a phone number in E.164 format. On calling, the function checks for authentication depending on the configuration of the extension. If the function is called without authentication from your Firebase app and the extension is configured to only allow authenticated calls, it will throw an error.

The function then returns an object with `status` - which can be either "approved" or "pending". 

Here's a basic example how you can call this function from your app to send a one time verification code:

```js
functions.httpsCallable('ext-${EXT_INSTANCE_ID}-twilioSendOTP')({
  number: "+919898989898", //E.164 Formatted number
  channel: "sms" //Can be "sms" or "call"
}).then(result => console.log(result.data.status))
```

The function `twilioCheckOTP` needs to be called with two variables: `code` - the verification code entered by the user, and `number` - a phone number in E.164 format. On calling, the function checks for authentication depending on the configuration of the extension. If the function is called without authentication from your Firebase app and the extension is configured to only allow authenticated calls, it will throw an error.

The function will authenticate the code with Twilio Verify and then return an object with `status` - which can be either "approved" or "pending". 

Here's a basic example how you can call this function from your app to send a one time verification code:

```js
functions.httpsCallable('ext-${EXT_INSTANCE_ID}-twilioCheckOTP')({
  number: "+919898989898", //E.164 Formatted number
  code: "123456" //Code entered by the user
}).then(result => console.log(result.data.status))
```
***EXT_INSTANCE_ID* is the instance ID of the extension and will be shown to you post installation.**

When you configure this extension, you'll need to provide your **Twilio Account SID, Auth Token and a Twilio Verify Service SID**. You can sign up and configure Twilio [here](https://www.twilio.com/verify).
